**Github Link: [https://github.com/Harrison1/unrealcpp/tree/master/AddRadialForce](https://github.com/Harrison1/unrealcpp/tree/master/AddRadialForce)**

*For this tutorial we are using the standard first person C++ template with starter content. If you don't know how to add a new actor class to your project, please visit the [Add C++ Actor Class](/add-actor-class) post.*

This tutorial is super fun, we are going to simulate a explosion by adding radial force to all objects within a set range.

Create a new actor called `AddRadialForce`. We don't have to do anything to the header file. Below is the default header file generated by Unreal.

### AddRadialForce.h
```cpp
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "GameFramework/Actor.h"
#include "AddRadialForce.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class UNREALCPP_API AAddRadialForce : public AActor
{
	GENERATED_BODY()
	
public:	
	// Sets default values for this actor's properties
	AAddRadialForce();

protected:
	// Called when the game starts or when spawned
	virtual void BeginPlay() override;

public:	
	// Called every frame
	virtual void Tick(float DeltaTime) override;
	
};
```

To help us during the debugging process, let's add the `DrawDebugHelpers` script to our code.

#### include DrawDebugHelpers.h
```cpp
#include "AddRadialForce.h"
// add debug helpfers
#include "DrawDebugHelpers.h"
```

In this example we are going to perform all of our logic inside the `BeginPlay()` function. We want to collect all the hit results that are within our range and get the results from our range's sweep. To do this we are going to use [TArrays](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/UnrealArchitecture/TArrays/) track our overlapping actors.

#### add hit result and sweep actors TArrays
```cpp
void AAddRadialForce::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();

	// create tarray for hit results
	TArray<FHitResult> OutHits;

	// crate tarray for sweep actors
	TArray<AActor*> SweepActors;
	
}
``` 

Next we're going to declare our `OutHits` TArray. We want the sweep range to start and end at this actor's position and have the `CollisionShape` be a sphere of 500 units. You get the actor's locatoin by using `GetActorLocation()` which returns a vector. We create a `CollisionShape` by using `FCollisionShape::MakeSphere(500.0f)` which returns a `FCollisionShape`.

#### add sweep variables and shape
```cpp
// Called when the game starts or when spawned
void AAddRadialForce::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();

	// create tarray for hit results
	TArray<FHitResult> OutHits;

	// get actor locations
	FVector MyLocation = GetActorLocation();
	
	// start and end locations. The sphere will create the radial sweep.
	FVector Start = MyLocation;
	FVector End = MyLocation;

	// create a collision sphere
	FCollisionShape MyColSphere = FCollisionShape::MakeSphere(500.0f);
	
}
```

To visualize the sphere of the sweepwe will draw a debug sphere.

#### DrawDebugSphere
```cpp
// Called when the game starts or when spawned
void AAddRadialForce::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();

	// create tarray for hit results
	TArray<FHitResult> OutHits;

	// get actor locations
	FVector MyLocation = GetActorLocation();
	
	// start and end locations. The sphere will create the radial sweep.
	FVector Start = MyLocation;
	FVector End = MyLocation;

	// create a collision sphere
	FCollisionShape MyColSphere = FCollisionShape::MakeSphere(500.0f);

	// draw collision sphere
    DrawDebugSphere(GetWorld(), GetActorLocation(), MyColSphere.GetSphereRadius(), 50, FColor::Cyan, true);
}
```

Next we have to check if our actor hits anything when we `BeginPlay()`. Every actor has the `GetWorld` function. From the `GetWorld()` function we will `SweepMultiByChannel` and set the paramaters to our variables we created above. This will `return` a `bool` indicating if actors are within range of this actor. Here is Unreal's documentation on [SweepMultiByChannel](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Runtime/Engine/Engine/UWorld/SweepMultiByChannel/).

```cpp
void AAddRadialForce::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();

	// create tarray for hit results
	TArray<FHitResult> OutHits;

	// get actor locations
	FVector MyLocation = GetActorLocation();
	
	// start and end locations. The sphere will create the radial sweep.
	FVector Start = MyLocation;
	FVector End = MyLocation;

	// create a collision sphere
	FCollisionShape MyColSphere = FCollisionShape::MakeSphere(500.0f);

	// draw collision sphere
	DrawDebugSphere(GetWorld(), GetActorLocation(), MyColSphere.GetSphereRadius(), 50, FColor::Cyan, true);
	
	// check if something got hit in the sweep
	bool isHit = GetWorld()->SweepMultiByChannel(OutHits, Start, End, FQuat::Identity, ECC_WorldStatic, MyColSphere);
	
}
```

If `isHit` is `true`, we will loop through the OutHits TArray and add radial impulse to each successful casted actor's root component. You can learn more about TArray for loops [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/UnrealArchitecture/TArrays/).

#### add hit actors to SweepActors.
```cpp

	if (isHit)
	{
		// loop through TArray
		for (auto& Hit : OutHits)
		{
			UStaticMeshComponent* MeshComp = Cast<UStaticMeshComponent>((Hit.GetActor())->GetRootComponent());

			if (MeshComp)
			{
                // alternivly you can use  ERadialImpulseFalloff::RIF_Linear for the impulse to get linearly weaker as it gets further from origin.
				// set the float radius to 500 and the float strength to 2000.
				MeshComp->AddRadialImpulse(GetActorLocation(), 500.f, 2000.f, ERadialImpulseFalloff::RIF_Constant, true);
			}
		}
	}

```

Below is the full `.cpp` file.

```cpp
#include "AddRadialForce.h"
// add debug helpfers
#include "DrawDebugHelpers.h"

// Sets default values
AAddRadialForce::AAddRadialForce()
{
 	// Set this actor to call Tick() every frame.  You can turn this off to improve performance if you don't need it.
	PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;

}

// Called when the game starts or when spawned
void AAddRadialForce::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();

	// create tarray for hit results
	TArray<FHitResult> OutHits;

	// get actor locations
	FVector MyLocation = GetActorLocation();
	
	// start and end locations. The sphere will create the radial sweep.
	FVector Start = MyLocation;
	FVector End = MyLocation;

	// create a collision sphere
	FCollisionShape MyColSphere = FCollisionShape::MakeSphere(500.0f);

	// draw collision sphere
	DrawDebugSphere(GetWorld(), GetActorLocation(), MyColSphere.GetSphereRadius(), 50, FColor::Cyan, true);
	
	// check if something got hit in the sweep
	bool isHit = GetWorld()->SweepMultiByChannel(OutHits, Start, End, FQuat::Identity, ECC_WorldStatic, MyColSphere);

	if (isHit)
	{
		// loop through TArray
		for (auto& Hit : OutHits)
		{
			UStaticMeshComponent* MeshComp = Cast<UStaticMeshComponent>((Hit.GetActor())->GetRootComponent());

			if (MeshComp)
			{
				// alternivly you can use  ERadialImpulseFalloff::RIF_Linear for the impulse to get linearly weaker as it gets further from origin.
				// set the float radius to 500 and the float strength to 2000.
				MeshComp->AddRadialImpulse(GetActorLocation(), 500.f, 2000.f, ERadialImpulseFalloff::RIF_Constant, true);
			}
		}
	}
	
}

// Called every frame
void AAddRadialForce::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
	Super::Tick(DeltaTime);

}
```
